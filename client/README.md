# React + Vite

## Environment Setup

To ensure the frontend functions correctly, you need to set up the environment variables properly. Define the following in your environment:

- `VITE_REACT_APP_SERVER`: This should match the port selected for the backend server.
- `VITE_REACT_APP_CLIENT`: This should match the port on which the frontend is running.

By default, the Vite server runs on port 3000.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
